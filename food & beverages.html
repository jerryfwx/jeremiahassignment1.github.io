<b>Ya Kun Kaya Toast</b>
<br>
<b>Open daily: 7:30am - 9:30pm, Last order at 9pm</b>
<br>
<b>Call us: 6261 5426</b>
<br>
The name Ya Kun invariably conjures up images of freshly made kaya toast in the minds of Singaporeans. What is unique about Ya Kun is that it offers the same humble fare of eggs, coffee and toast made with its special proprietary kaya recipe, prepared exactly the same way as when it first started in 1944. With 75 years of history, Ya Kun is a household name well-loved by all. A place where generations of Singaporeans gather to chat and indulge in their favourite coffee, it’s also where you can get scrumptious traditional kaya toast served with soft-boiled eggs. It is certainly the place that captures the true meaning of ‘The Toast that binds.... Kinship, friendship, partnership’.
